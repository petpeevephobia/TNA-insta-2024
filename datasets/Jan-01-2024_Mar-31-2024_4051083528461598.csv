The most exciting part of business is probably when you get your first customer.

But before even achieving that, slow and meticulous work is still needed in the beginning.

So if you favour only the wins but fear the mundane, then steer away from entrepreneurship.

Read on to know 3 more truths about starting and running my web agency solo 👇🏽

1️⃣ Client acquisition is not only about volume, but also about continuous iteration on strategy — Conduct research on the most common pain points that your target customers face, then personalise your messages to solve those problems.

2️⃣ It’s ok to have a boring business — Boring means simple. The simpler your business idea is, the more customers you can get. Why? Because it’s extremely easy for them to understand how they can benefit from your service/product.

3️⃣ Network is everything as a beginner — This was how I got my first clients and gained invaluable lessons that I can immediately apply into my own entrepreneurial pursuit. Making new friends is probably my favourite part of running a business!

Do you have any lessons you learnt from your own entrepreneurial journey? I would love to hear them. 👂🏽

Here's how to map it on your landing page:

1️⃣ Awareness: Introduce your brand and value proposition clearly. (Did you know first impressions matter? 80% of website visitors judge your brand based on design alone!)

2️⃣ Consideration: Address their pain points and highlight how your product solves them.

3️⃣ Decision: Make it easy to take the next step! Clear CTAs and trust signals, like testimonials & reviews, are key.

By guiding users through this journey, you easily build trust, address concerns, and ultimately drive conversions. Great web design starts from putting your customers first! ☝🏽

Here are my favourite low-code web builders for founders who are going solo, or teams that may not have 5 years to learn how to code.

However, if I had to choose among Durable, Shopify, Webflow, and Wordpress, I would go for Webflow 100%. 🏆

My experience with Webflow has been positive so far because I have extensive background knowledge in HTML and CSS, thanks to the loads of free time I had after Secondary school graduation. 😅

I’ve been in the startup scene since 2021 and fell in love with the adventures that founders frequently experience.

In the past, I attempted to establish a local clothing brand, an e-commerce store, and a social enterprise.

All of them ceased operations because I began without a plan, the brand mission was too weak, and the startup had no solid product or service to offer. 📉

Despite my endeavours, the startup scene in Southeast Asia continues to grow every single day, so I had no rush to start something up again.

I stepped back from entrepreneurship for a bit to focus on my studies, and realised that my calling had been with me all this time. It was web design!

An eureka moment; I could still remain in the startup space but instead of launching my own, why not I help other startups grow instead? 💡

I could never let go of entrepreneurship. I love the energy, the impact, the satisfaction, and the failures that come with being a founder.

↓

That’s why I don’t want to be the best web design agency in the world. Instead, I want to be the best web design agency for YOU! 🫵🏽

Startups are different from established companies. They have different problems and different needs.

Being in the startup culture for a while, I have gained knowledge from watching countless business pitches and participating in some. 🧠

So look no further for a web designer who can offer your startup the web services that it needs.

Don't worry, the solution is easier than you think! Read on to stay ahead of the web game ;)

1️⃣ Showcase who you are from the very first click: Make your logo prominent and recognizable. Include a clear tagline that briefly explains what your business offers.

2️⃣ Highlight the most important pages: Feature an ""About Us"" page that tells your story, builds trust, and showcases your values. Include a dedicated ""Services"" page that clearly outlines what your business offers and the problems you solve.

3️⃣ Optimize your navigation for conversions: Use clear and concise calls to action (CTAs) that tell visitors exactly what you want them to do next, whether it's ""Contact Us,"" ""Get a Quote,"" or ""Learn More.""

With these key steps, you can create a web navigation system that intuitively guides users towards achieving their goals (and buying more of your services/products). 👆

That's why I'm passionate about UX design - to prove that websites are more than pretty pictures on the internet.

I crafted my first ever Wixsite to raise awareness about the negative effects of deforestation for a school project. 🌲

It was showcased to the entire school as a way to promote their Applied learning Programme (ALP).

The Kind Hearts website was one of my proudest creations, mainly because it featured one of my favourite animals, the red panda ❤️🐼

I can barely recall the design thinking process of building that Wixsite, but I know for sure that I did not start off as a pro. I can’t even say that I’m a pro today.

This is a reminder that your experiences and skills will compound over one another, until they form what is commonly known as “your expertise”. 🧠

You know what else would help speed up that process? Forming new connections! This will help you in 3 ways:

1️⃣ To fulfil or advise on tasks that you are weak in.

2️⃣ To refine your offers and provide maximum value to your clients.

3️⃣ To support your ambitions as like-minded individuals who are on a similar journey.

I’m still a young and learning web agency owner, but I have great visions for what is to come. I’m a very outgoing person, so if you want to form a new connection, drop me a DM! 😉

Craft a homepage that immediately grasps your users’ attention. Inject personality, passion, and maybe a sprinkle of wit into your web copy. ✨ 
 
1️⃣ SPEAK YOUR TRUTH. What makes your brand stand out? Weave your brand personality into your captions, blog articles, and emails. Provide value and show a unique perspective.
 
2️⃣ SELL THE DREAM, NOT THE PROCESS. Write to your users like you would a friend. People connect with real people, not emotionless AI-generated text. 
 
3️⃣ DITCH THE CONFUSING JARGON. If not, the user would be disengaged and leave your website without even giving your brand a chance. Try to use clear and concise language that even your grandma could understand (unless your grandma’s a rocket scientist, then go for it).

Here are some points I learned from this project:

✨ Brand Immersion: Enter your client's head and heart, then use it all to create authentic messages throughout the website.

🎯 Write copy with a purpose: Words paint vivid pictures, use them to showcase your client's vision and make it real.

🖼️ Visual Harmony: Don't mix and match. Use the brand kit like a palette, creating a consistent and memorable experience.

Verdé proves that when its design aligns with its brand, magic happens. We built a website that was ready to secure funding and become the foundation for a thriving platform for farmers and businesses in Singapore.

This is your cheat sheet to the HOTTEST trends taking the web by storm (and how they can turbocharge your growth!)

1. Micro-animations: ⚡ Think of subtle movements, like buttons that wiggle or icons that dance. They add a sprinkle of magic ✨ and boost engagement like whoa!

2. Bold & Playful Typography:  Ditch the generic fonts! Embrace expressive typefaces that reflect your brand personality and make readers do a double-take (in a good way!).

3. Storytelling Through Data:  Charts and graphs can be SO much more than just numbers. Craft visuals that tell a compelling story of your impact and make data dance the night away.

4. Immersive Experiences:  VR, AR, 360º content... The future is here, and it's interactive! Give your visitors a reason to stay and explore ️, not just click and bounce.

5. Sustainable Design:  Eco-conscious choices are no longer a ""nice to have,"" they're a must-have. Opt for a minimal, resource-friendly design and showcase your commitment to a greener future (even if your startup may not be focused on saving the polar bears).

Dive in, experiment, and let your website become the playground for these trends.

I hear you loud and clear. I've seen countless startups and small businesses freeze up at the mention of ""mobile-friendly"" and ""SEO."" Trust me, I get it.

That's what I'm here for: To take the mystery out of web design and make it accessible for everyone.

Here's how I tackle common small business web design woes! 👇🏽

Q: ""I haven't got a clue where to start! 😖""
A: Start by identifying your brand’s mission. Then, define what services or products you are providing. Afterwards, define who your target customers are. Do those 3 things, and you’ve got a good foundation to ideate what your website could look like for your users.

Q: ""Mobile-friendly? SEO-friendly? What does it all mean? 😱""
A: Mobile-friendly refers to whether your website is capable of resizing itself on various devices. This is also termed as responsiveness. SEO-friendly refers to how easily web crawlers can scan through your website to extract keywords from it. Why is this important? It’s so that it’s easier for your business to gain more visibility on Google (and other search engines)

Q: ""My budget is tight ... is beautiful design even possible? 🥲""
A: Everyone deserves impactful and beautiful design. TNA offers scalable solutions tailored to your needs, so with us, you'll get a stunning website that drives results, without breaking the bank.

1. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. 🧠 They're not just clicks, they're humans! Understand their needs, wants, and quirks. Your website should feel like a warm welcome, not a confusing maze. ️

2. CONTENT IS KING (AND QUEEN)! 📚 Fresh, engaging content keeps visitors immersed. Blog posts, articles, even catchy captions - feed their curiosity and keep them coming back for more.

3. GOTTA GO FAST. ⚡ No one likes a sluggish site. Optimize your loading times, ditch the huge images, and make navigation a breeze. Why? Because slow websites = lost leads.

4. LISTEN & ITERATE. 📊 Your website is a living, breathing thing. Track user behaviour, gather feedback, and constantly tweak to improve the experience. Think of it as a never-ending (but rewarding!) conversation with your audience. ️
