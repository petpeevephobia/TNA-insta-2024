Here is a simple hack to know where to start improving your website:

Check your bounce rates on Google Analytics. 🔍

Bounce rates indicate the percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing only one page without taking any further action.

A high bounce rate means visitors aren't engaging with your content. 🚪💨

Those pages then become your priority areas for improvement!

When TNA launched, I was not expecting my first client to be a friend I met in polytechnic.

Being able to empower them on their business mission—it empowered me to pursue mine.

That’s why it’s important to me that my clients win. If they do, I win too.

How did I manage to get a friend to pay for my web services?

Read on to know what I did, plus many other hacks I use as a solopreneur:

1. Limited marketing budget? 💰 Create content for free on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram, and scale from there.

2. Low website traffic? 🚦 Optimize your website for SEO using Google Keyword Planner.

3. Lacking expertise in certain areas? ⚙️ Outsource a freelancer, or pay a skilled friend to help.

4. Your customers don’t trust you? 🗝️ Add real testimonials to your website and social media.

5. Can’t find your target customers? 🔍 Ask and answer questions in Reddit communities that your target customers are in.

6. Managing too many customer relationships? 🌀 Use Excel, Notion, or the free version of Hubspot CRM.

7. Not getting your first paying customer? 🛒 Offer a “grand opening” discount or free trial on your product or service.

The only thing solo entrepreneurs need to know is that “Good design is less design”.

Your users don’t ask for much when looking for a great web experience.

So don’t overdo it! ✋

For them to want to buy from your business, here are the crucial elements you must have in your website:

1️⃣ A compelling CTA — Instead of a generic “Click Here,” try something more specific like “Start Your Free Trial”

2️⃣ Testimonials that highlight your USPs — Add photos and quotes from happy customers to create a more relatable and trustworthy experience.

3️⃣ FAQ to handle potential customer objections — Include questions like, “What is your return policy?” or “How long does shipping take?” to keep your customers informed.

4️⃣ Comparison table that makes your business stand out — Create a table comparing your basic, pro, and premium plans, highlighting the key features and benefits of each.

5️⃣ Showcase your product or past works — For a product, include a video tutorial or demo. For a service, display a portfolio or case studies with detailed outcomes and client testimonials.

Don't get me wrong, large-scale agencies have the upper hand when it comes to reach.

Jumping straight into that world wasn’t the wisest choice for a young entrepreneur like myself.

By keeping things lean, I can focus more on creativity and less on overhead. 💡

Plus, I’ve got a small, yet incredibly capable, close-knit team by my side.

We’re all passionate about what we do, and that makes every project a joy to work on! ❤️

Still, nothing can beat forming meaningful relationships with my clients.

Direct communication allows me to know them on a personal level, rather than a shallow client-contractor relationship.

I get to understand their mission, passion, and muse, making our work together even more impactful. 🌐

Together with my small team, I have designed numerous websites for various small innovative businesses.

This is THE set of rules I personally follow throughout my client projects!

1️⃣ Keep it modern & simple: Get inspired by clean designs like wise.com, apple.com, and notion.so/product. Less clutter means more focus on your message.

2️⃣ Make important info easy to find: Ensure vital info like contact details, terms & conditions, and refund policies are obvious on the website.

3️⃣ Use 2 main colours: The goal isn't to create a rainbow, but a brand identity. Go for complementary or neutral tones for a pleasing palette.

4️⃣ Use clear images & videos: Use high-quality visuals to showcase your product or service, but keep file sizes in check to ensure fast loading times.

5️⃣ Use micro animations: Use subtle animations like fade-ins to guide users through your site. But beware, less is more! Overdoing it can be distracting.

Here is what all solopreneurs building their own websites have to understand; Less design is good design.

Simplicity not only enhances usability but also puts your message front and center.

With me, I don't just work for you; I work *with* you.

I remember working with a startup founder who was really into connecting Singaporeans in support of self-sustainable agriculture.

She had a bold vision for her website, which was to be showcased to potential investors.

However, she felt lost in the technical jargon big web agencies threw at her and had limited funds to invest in building a website. 😵‍💫

We met on Google Meet and connected over shared goals and values for Singapore’s 2030 goals towards food sustainability.

I learned about her mission, dreams, and even her love for travelling! ✈️

Together, we crafted a website that not only showcased her unique selling points, but told her startup’s story.

Today, we're still in touch, cheering on each other's successes. 💛

This is the kind of relationship we cherish—more than just a client, but a partner and a friend.

Have a feeling that my team and I could be the right partner for you too? Then send me a DM!

When managing multiple clients solo, having a solid system in place is crucial.

It reduces mental load and decision fatigue, allowing you to work efficiently and accomplish more.

That's why I rely on Notion as my project manager.

Using Notion's smart table feature, I track each client's project timeline, to-dos, and website drafts—all in one organized space. 📋

To optimise my workflow, I also integrate Playbook, Figma, and Google Drive for storing contracts, proposals, and website assets.

It's all about streamlining and staying on top of everything!

The second important element to project management is delegation. 📅

Founders should focus on driving money-making decisions, while a capable team supports the process.

While I love designing websites, I trust my team to take the lead on most projects when I need to conserve my mental energy for the overall business goal. ⭐

Two takeaways: Utilise Notion, and delegate tasks.

Yeah the ones that don’t try to compete with the global coffee giants.

Reminds me of coffee shops in Amsterdam (iykyk).

Those niche businesses need an agency that ""gets"" them, not one that tries to fit them into a one-size-fits-all template. 🧩

Now imagine specialised agencies to be those baristas who know exactly how you like your coffee.

No fancy gimmicks, just the perfect brew (web solution) tailored to your taste (needs).

These agencies don’t waste time and money on unnecessary web packages. ⌛

They’re all about crafting solutions that make sense for your unique business.

And because they’ve been brewing in your industry for a while, they know the best beans (design tricks) to use 💡

Plus, working with them feels more like a partnership and less like ordering off a generic menu.

They’re passionate about your niche, just like that barista who knows your name and has your order ready before you even ask.

So, if you’re a niche business, think of a specialised agency as your go-to coffee shop:

✅ Reliable,

✅ Efficient,

✅ And always brewing up something that’s just right for you.

Since the start of 2024, I’ve been taking steps towards achieving emotional clarity to strengthen my decision-making skills.

One concept to remember is to schedule time for the brain to recharge itself. ✨

How? That could be blocking an hour to read a timeless book title, to take a walk, or to chat with the team to learn what’s on their mind.

It’s important to enjoy the projects that you deliver, but equally important to step back and ensure that you’re on the right track. ✅

I recommend reading Chapter 5 of “Essentialism” by Greg McKeown to study more about this.

As business owners, we must be the rock that grounds the team, especially during crisis and such.

Emotional clarity can help us achieve that! ⛰️

My favourite clarity time is to take a walk hehe.

A study by Harvard Business School, “The Power of Small Wins”, states that positive feedback has a profound effect on our productivity.

So why not make working a fun experience? 🎈

Play invites you to make mistakes without the pressure of being perfect.

During play, failure nudges you towards new possibilities.

Because you become detached from “winning”, the energy you put into your craft becomes more sincere, rather than uptight iykwim. 💝

You start to create adventure, find fun, without stressing about the stakes.

As a creative, I value that mental and emotional freedom.

So playing during business hours is crucial for productivity in the team! 🔋

An effective SEO strategy helps to bring more traffic, more sales, and in turn, potentially more revenue. 🔥

There is no one-size-fits-all SEO strategy, which is why iterative testing is so important.

Here are 8 easy ways you can start pumping up your reach online.

1️⃣ Optimize for keywords: Find the right terms your audience is searching for and use them smartly throughout your site.

2️⃣ Create high-quality content — Offer valuable content that keeps your visitors engaged on your website.

3️⃣ Help your website run faster — Use optimally sized images or videos, and use animations sparingly.

6️⃣ Optimise meta descriptions and title tags — Write clear, keyword-rich meta descriptions and titles that attract clicks.

7️⃣ Leverage social media — Share your content on social media to reach more people and drive traffic to your site.

Make fear your friend when you’re running a business. ➕

When doubt creeps in, don’t push it away—embrace it.

That uncertainty is what sharpens your edge and keeps you striving for more. 📈

Sometimes, you may catch myself thinking, “My customers may not like this”.

But that’s just fear trying to mess with your focus. 😠

Instead of letting fear paralyse you, use it to fuel your growth!

This is what I would do:

1️⃣ Embrace the fear—Channel it into action by imagining how your role model would handle it.

2️⃣ Teach someone what you know—Fear fades when you reinforce your knowledge by sharing it.

3️⃣ Flip your mindset—Shift from “I have to…” to “I choose to…” and reclaim control over your narrative.

So I got distracted.

-

I had to regain my certainty about TNA, so this was what I did:

1️⃣ Ask the 5 Whys — question your thoughts from an outside perspective.

2️⃣ Apply the Commanders’ Intent — set your purpose, its end state, and its key tasks.

3️⃣ Set a NICE goal — it must be near-term, input-based, controllable, and energising.

4️⃣ Create “When … then …” statements to execute that goal. — “When I watch the TV, I do 5 push-ups.”

5️⃣ Time block tasks in 1-hour slots. — invest your energy effectively.

-

I know what would happen if I stopped doing web design with TNA.

But what would happen if I just kept going?

It’s been a month since my return, and I’m settling down once more.

Although I miss Europe, I think it’s important to know when to cut down on adventures and go back to routine.

I’ll be covering some of these points deeper in future posts.

If you want to find out more, I recommend reading “Feel Good Productivity” by Ali Abdaal.

But for now, take this as a concrete overview plan towards regaining your purpose.

Yeah I said it.

Many team members?

That often means too much time sitting on ideas instead of bringing them to life. 😕

When needed, I outsource tricky tasks to freelancers so I can focus on the project’s big picture.

But honestly I don’t see myself hiring a bunch of full-timers anytime soon, beyond the solid duo I already have.

Here’s how I trimmed the fat to boost TNA’s productivity:

1️⃣ Cut out liabilities that don’t add value.

2️⃣ Delegate smarter—not to do more, but to waste less.

3️⃣ Correct as we go while keeping our mission to empower startups crystal clear.

4️⃣ Observe changes and resist the urge to over-edit.

Keeping the team lean and flexible keeps those creative juices flowing.

Saving on costs is just a sweet bonus!

What do you think?

Are small agencies, like The Nadra Agency (TNA), actually a bust or a potential for success?

Trust. 😉

Crafting personalised experiences for targeted users is my specialty.

Here are key points I often recall when doing so:

1️⃣ Make navigation clear and easy to use.

2️⃣ Ensure fast loading speed.

3️⃣ Design for both mobile & desktop experiences.

4️⃣ Use readable fonts & layouts.

5️⃣ Use strong CTAs.

Focusing on these essentials will boost engagement as well as user retention.

Robots are lifeless.

Robots are unimaginative.

And robots don’t care!

That’s unfortunate because customers want to be cared for. 💞

They buy products and services that matter most to them.

But before throwing money at you, they want to know how that product makes their life easier.

So hear me out on this …

Human-centric copy that connects on a personal level. ⬅️

✅ Highlight the benefits, not just the features.

✅ Make it all about your customer. It’s not about you.

✅ Cut out the corporate jargon—talk like a human.

✅ Be specific. The more clear, the more convincing.

✅ Guide them to the next step with clear, inspiring CTAs.

Being a good salesperson doesn’t always mean you’re a good copywriter. 💡

Copywriting takes practice.

Test different versions, listen to what your customers are saying, and work those insights into your copy.

It’s like what I’ve been saying about web design in general as well.

Once you get this right, selling online will feel a lot less stressful.

5 hours of doom scrolling later, I often feel frustrated and drained.

I’ve decided to make a change.

1️⃣ To transform my phone into a tool, not a toy.

Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I’m opting for analogue alternatives:

Using pen and paper for notes/journaling, and a physical alarm clock.

Less distraction, more action.

2️⃣ I’ve also started waking up at 0600 and hitting the showers right away.

Tackling tasks at that timing helps me cross off things that matter …

Like completing more than 70% of a CRO course, preparing for uni applications, and more.

-

Still, I’m learning to trust the process, even if results don’t show up immediately.

It’s easy to feel like we’re not doing enough, but sometimes, the /doing/ **is enough.

As Ryan Holiday mentions in Ego is the Enemy, “To BE somebody or to DO something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision.”

And that’s what I’m committing to every day.

I’m putting this post out to keep myself accountable.

At the end of the day, your website needs to look good.

But more importantly, it needs to work well. ⚙️

Functionality will always beat aesthetics when it comes to driving real results.

Think about it.

If visitors can’t easily book a service, make a purchase, or fill out a form, the prettiest website won’t help you convert.

Of course, design matters too.

The colors, fonts, images, and layout all shape how your brand is perceived.

So, a balanced approach is key.

Takeaway ➡️ Prioritise a functional user experience, and let your brand aesthetics enhance it.

A seamless website is a visual extension of your brand that makes users want to stick around.

What do you think: aesthetics or functionality?

As a solo founder, you’ve probably wondered how to begin designing your website.

They could be browsing your website with their 4-Door Flex™ with AI Family Hub™+ Samsung smart fridge.

So really, it’s no one-size-fits-all approach.

Humour aside, there are 2 ways you can start sketching that wireframe.

📱 Mobile-first

With over 50% of global web traffic coming from mobile, designing with mobile users lets your business meet your audience where they are.

When you design starting from the mobile experience, you’ll create more efficient designs that adapt great on desktop screens and seamlessly on phone screens.

💻 Desktop-first

This one’s for businesses where most users still browse on larger screens.

This approach ensures you deliver the full experience without compromise.

In this case, you’d be designing from the large desktop screen, down to mobile size.

-

So which should you focus on?

It depends on your target audience and their browsing habits.

But be careful.

Choosing the wrong approach could hurt conversions. 😞

I’ve helped my clients maximise their website’s potential through tailored design strategies.

So if you’re not sure which strategy is right for your website, I’m just a DM away! 📩

Share with me your website’s details, and I’ll give you my honest opinion.
