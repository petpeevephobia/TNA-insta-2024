I was convinced I was about to face embarrassment or feel like a total failure if things didn't take off.

But here's the thing, I realised that all those big words – failure, humiliation, shame – they're just shadows once you shine a light on them. 🔦

All it takes is that first step, be it take part in a competition, post an ad, anything really. And then, the fear starts to fade.

Facing those fears head-on changes the game completely.

Suddenly, you're not held back by what-ifs or the fear of falling flat. 💪🏽

You learn that making a move, any move, is better than standing still.

That first leap is where the magic starts, and everything after that? It's just part of the ride! 🎢

Although my startup idea did not really take off back then, I managed to explore the possibility of it even happening at all.

Life's too short to just sit on awesome ideas, right?

Just wanted to drop this here, in case you've been on the fence about kicking off your own thing.

Remember founder friends, the only real failure is not starting at all. 🫡

When I started The Nadra Agency (TNA), the freedom to make quick decisions pays off massively.

Iterating our web design process to prioritise revisions for our clients optimised our speed and quality of deliverables. 📈

Discussing it with my supportive team members helped refine the idea before implementation. 💬

Even though I'm the only founder, having a team that voices their opinions is invaluable!

So scaling solo is possible. It’s better to hustle meaningfully and independently, rather than working with an unmotivated and distracting co-founder. 👍🏽

The key is to make quick iterations with clear goals in mind.

Don’t be afraid to take control as a solo founder! It’s important to embrace this journey and thrive with a community of other solo founders too. 🔥

Sometimes breaking the rules is the key to landing page success.

Here are 5 quick wins (with risky takes) for optimisation that might surprise you:

1️⃣ Simplify your design – but don't be afraid to add a touch of flair if it fits your brand.
2️⃣ Craft a compelling headline – sometimes a bit of controversy grabs attention!
3️⃣ Use high-quality visuals – balance is key, too many can slow you down.
4️⃣ Optimise your CTA – a softer approach like “Learn More” might just do the trick if you know how to use it.
5️⃣ Improve page speed – but a slight delay with a loading animation can build anticipation.

Optimising your landing page doesn’t have to be a daunting task.

Implement these quick wins, test them out, and see how they impact your conversions.

Startup founders often grapple with numerous challenges, so it's easy to lose sight of why the journey began in the first place. 🌪️

One way to maintain focus during turbulent times is by regularly revisiting the core mission and values that inspired the startup.

Stay connected to your ""why."" Reflect on why you started this journey in the first place.

Networking. 👍🏽

Talking to get those first few clients sounds easy until you're in a room full of strangers.

The real trick is breaking the ice without feeling awkward.

I've been hitting up a lot of events to meet potential clients, and man, it's like being back in secondary school trying to make new friends.

But seriously, that was how I met the best clients to ever work with. And turns out, laying on a compliment is a great opener.

Noticed someone's sharp style or how they carry themselves? Say it. It's amazing how a little praise can lead to real conversations. 🗣️

Then, it's all about getting into their world. What's bugging them about their current products or services?

I listen, really listen, and it's not long before we're chatting like old mates about needs and solutions.

It's CRUCIAL to keep it chill, more like a chat over coffee than a sales pitch. ☕

And remember to be genuine. Laugh, show surprise, be human.

It makes all the difference in not only feeling more relaxed but also in making those connections feel real and not forced. 🤖➡️👫

This approach has been a game changer. It's not just about finding clients but about building relationships that feel meaningful.

Plus, it's a nice reminder that at the end of the day, being human is our biggest asset in business. 👍

This approach has reshaped how I approach not just business, but every new person I meet.

Who knew networking could actually be fun? 🎉

Turns out, a lot of folks think of websites as just a space to dump all their biz info. But that’s just skimming the surface!

A website has insane growth power for a business, way beyond just being a digital flyer. 🚀

Take it from our experience. Looking beyond the traditional view of a website transformed how customers find and engage with us.

It’s not just about showing up online. It’s about how you can pull in the right crowd - organically. 🌱

When our website started to do more - like really hook people’s attention and guide them through what we offer - that's when the magic happened.

More eyeballs on our site meant more people interested in what we do. And voila, more sales followed. 💰

It’s been a game-changer, treating the website as an active tool in our growth arsenal.

Not just a passive page. It's about making sure those who land on it find exactly what they need and stick around or come back for more. 🎣

It’s amazing how a little shift in perspective about websites can open up new growth avenues for a biz. Might be something worth considering ;)

For example, Apple uses black and white to signal transparency and simplicity, while Duolingo's green aims to evoke growth and positivity.

Choosing the right colours for a website is an intuitive process for designers, but a bit more structured for business owners.

The trick is to first define the brand's personality, almost like it's a person. 🧠 For instance, if Apple were a person, I'd see it as a tech-savvy individual focused on growth, hence the neutral colours.

Once you've nailed down the brand personality, you match it with the psychology of colours: red for passion, white for purity, blue for reliability, and so on.

Pick colours that align with the brand's core traits and build around one main colour. 🎯

Understanding the impact of colour can elevate a brand's web presence significantly. Try it out!

But here we are, a functioning web design agency born out of sheer stubborn passion for business and web design.

My advice to student entrepreneurs would be to make as many friends as possible in your school’s startup space.

If your school does not have that kind of environment, then sign up for entrepreneurial events in your city. You won’t regret it.

Be crazily persistent, and even the riskiest moves can work out. 🌟

The Nadra Agency (TNA) figured out a kind of recipe that keeps things straightforward yet comprehensive enough so people understand the value without feeling bombarded.

1️⃣ Hero: Show how you can help and spark action.

2️⃣ Value propositions: Why customers should choose you.

3️⃣ Social proof: Testimonials and stats for trust.

4️⃣ FAQ: To clear up any hesitations.

5️⃣ Call-to-action: A final nudge towards action, whether that's buying, subscribing, or booking a call.

Getting the spacing right between elements on a website can truly make or break its look, so I've started using the 8-point grid system as a guideline.

If I'm spacing out a paragraph and an image, I'll start with an 8px gap and adjust from there. It's all about experimenting to see what's pleasing to the eye. 👀

When it comes to making sure everything looks good on any device or screen size, I've learned the magic of reusable components.

Make one change to the main component, and like magic, it updates everywhere. This trick has been a lifesaver. 🪄

But here's where it gets really cool - adjusting all of this to fit the unique vibe of each client.

For luxury brands, I go big on white space. It gives that feel of elegance and exclusivity. 💎

For more budget-friendly brands, I tighten up the space to convey efficiency and accessibility. 💸

It's all about understanding what you want your brand to say and making sure the website speaks the same language.

Running The Nadra Agency has really shown me how much my own belief in myself affects the creativity in my web design work.

Imagine trying to help startups do better, but some days you’re not even sure if you should bother getting out of bed. 🤔

It’s tough balancing client work, chasing growth, and making sure everything's on track. When things pile up and I feel lost, it’s so easy to think no one notices or cares about what I’m doing. 😓

What keeps me sane? Writing. Getting all my thoughts and struggles down on paper helps me deal with self-doubt.

Journaling is my way of reminding myself to stay focused. Focused on creating, helping the startup world, and on growing personally. 📝💪

There was a time when what everyone else thought I should be doing nearly knocked me sideways with frustration. I felt like I was never doing enough.

But writing helped me step back from my work, emotionally speaking, and remember I’m more than my job.

Treating myself like a friend in my journal, I manage to strip away the negativity by being objective but also supportive. 📚❤️

So, whenever things get too much, try taking a step back. Being kind and real with yourself can change everything.

Just thought I’d share this because it’s something that helps me stay positive, and maybe it can do the same for you. 😊

But, get this: AI's not taking our place.

The soul of design, especially when we're talking user experience, is all about that human warmth and understanding. Getting what people really need on a level robots just can't touch.

Turns out, they're a perfect match for businesses that need their users to focus on a single action. They're slick on mobile, easy to read, and straight-up magnetic when it comes to conversions.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The challenge? One-page websites are kinda stuck in the mud when it comes to keywords targeting, SEO, and scaling up.

(Let’s not even start on the content limits.)

But one-product stores, agencies, and SaaS businesses though? They could totally rock a one-page website.

You may have a founder friend who needs a website, but not sure where to start. Well send them to my DMs!

Perhaps a quick, affordable, and effective one-page solution is the way to go.

I've found it takes a deep dive to really grasp their unique solution, the problem they're tackling, and who they're speaking to.

But I've put together a foolproof framework for their landing pages! ☝🏽🤓

With inspiration from the customers’ buying process, here is the web content that startup websites specifically need:

1️⃣ What is the problem that the product is trying to solve?

2️⃣ What results can users expect when using the product?

3️⃣ How can people get their hands on this product?

The Conversion Checklist for Tech Startups is a game-changer.

Why? Because it's built for those without a design background to significantly boost their conversion rates, with NO costs and NO brainwork.

It aims to reduce a significant chunk of the guesswork for passionate founders and their online customers.

Make your landing page clear and good sales will naturally come your way.

If you want to get your hands on this checklist for free, just DM me “LIST” to express your interest. Be the first to get it.

Turns out, there's so much more behind the scenes that can either make or break a user's experience. I learned this the hard way with a client's e-commerce site.

The design was on point, but sales were low. The issue? A checkout process that felt like running a marathon with unnecessary hurdles! 🏃🏽‍♀️

It was a real eye-opener. Usability isn't just about aesthetics; it's about understanding and adapting to the user's needs, especially in a diverse region like ASEAN.

We made big changes – simplified the checkout steps, added local languages and payment options, and made sure the site worked like a charm on mobile. 👑

Plus, we were completely transparent about all costs upfront and added those trust signals for extra security.

The payoff was almost immediate! Sales picked up, proving that when you put the user's experience first, success follows.

It was a fascinating journey, one that really showed the balance between beauty and functionality, all while keeping a finger on the pulse of what the user actually needs. 🧠

Hope this case study allows you to learn how you can improve your own website’s conversion rates.

Based on Joseph Campbell's quote, this is my BLISS/TRUE NORTH: Time freedom to appreciate as much Mother Nature, live music, and memories with loved ones as I can while I’m still kicking.

Over the last 3 years, I've learned that your passion can truly open unexpected doors. Meeting people from different corners of the entrepreneurship world has changed the game for me.

@sanderssays said, ""Your network is your net worth,"" and I've found this to be true in more ways than one. 👌🏽

My network transformed my thinking and approach to life tremendously!!!

I've been lucky to connect with folks in policy-making, agency operations, investing, self-improvement, and the startup scene.

One piece of advice that really stuck with me came from a business mentor. 🎓

When launching a business, it's important to identify what the business is championing, what it’s changing in the market, and who would appreciate this change.

This bit of wisdom has become a template for how I deliver elevator pitches for my business ideas. It's like building a bridge for others to easily walk across and understand how this idea is a good one from my perspective. 🌉

This makes it easier for the listener to say “Yes, let’s go!” but of course, they are also free to say “No”.

It’s all about making the decision-making process easier for them (and perhaps veering their response towards an ideal one?).

I hope sharing this might offer you a new perspective on pursuing your own bliss, which naturally becomes your True North.

Once you know your bliss, “Trust the process” is a saying that becomes easier to follow. Following your passion not only opens doors but builds new ones where there were none. 🚪

We scan, starting from the top left, moving in a pattern that looks like the letter ""F.""

To grab attention, I've started using headlines that pop and small chunks of text.

And guess what? Bold points and bullet lists catch our eyes when we scan. ⬅️

Images help too, breaking up the text and adding some flair.

I've been checking if people like the changes by doing A/B testing.

Seeing which website version people prefer lets me know I'm on the right track. 👍🏽

And you know what? It's working! People stick around longer, and they're clicking more.

Isn't it cool how simple changes can make such a big difference?

It's because their websites don't guide you through understanding their benefits properly.

It's like there's no easy path for users to see why the startup’s tech should matter to them.

This got me thinking about how this could be fixed … 🤔

I've been working on the ""Startup Conversion Checklist"" to help startups lay out their websites better.

The idea is to mimic the customer's journey: Awareness, consideration, action.

Simple, right? But surprisingly not many get it right.

I'm all about sharing what I know and helping out however I can.
