They’re young, driven, and laser-focused on making their business work.

Them and I, we’re not that different. 🌱

But I get it.

As much as you’re pushing forward, the stress of trying to double your revenue can be overwhelming.

I’ve worked with startups that were on tight budgets.

They were unsure if they could afford web design services.

That’s why I introduced a pricing model designed specifically for you.

Profit-sharing.

➡️ You don’t pay until you land your first customer through the website we build.

Every lead your website generates means more revenue for you AND us.

So doubling your revenue and conversion rates is the ultimate goal. 🚀

When you win, I win too.

If that doesn't resonate with you, you might want to look for startup web services elsewhere...

Else, drop me a DM to learn more. ;)

Biggest takeaway was: small daily changes lead to big results. The pareto principle basically.

One fantastic example is my toxic attachment to my phone.

I started tracking how long I stayed on my phone before getting out of bed.

Got to cut down from 6 hours to 1 hour of average screen time in a month.

That helped me get 30+ cold emails sent and S$1000+ in agency revenue generated.

-

This year, I had the choice to continue studying or start working full-time.

Instead, I did NONE of that and spent the summer in Germany. Quirky like that.

I came back home with a fresh perspective on who I am and what I should do to live truest to myself.

Since then, I’ve doubled down on my agency and began applying to undergrad programmes.

For 2025, my goals are simple: get into university, make S$2000 in revenue for TNA in one month, and explore one new country (solo again of course).

-

I have immeasurable love for everyone in this recap reel, regardless of when, where and how I met you lmao.

//discord, dating apps, alcohol, iykyk

You helped me find myself, and I hope I returned the favour.

Here’s to progress, not perfection.

Get the thing done and let it be ugly, cause you’ll make it better later.

Share your ‘25 goals here as well, so I can watch you achieve them!

POUT AND MOVE ON!!! :))) Happy new year",52,"12/30/2024 18:53",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEOgcyVv5b9/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,158,144,5,0,1,0,195

Probably the cheesiest thing I’ll say on Insta.

It’s true tho, every project with me is a collab built on open communication.

As a business owner who also outsources at times, it reassures me to know how far a project is going.

However, working with a freelancer or a white label feels quite isolating…

Maybe I’m just extroverted (ENTJ), but I love connecting with the person who is helping my business grow.

Sooo the idea to use a partner portal for every client in TNA was born!

It’s a personalised portal where clients can access everything about their project in one place.

Timelines, contracts, invoices, prototypes, and even real-time updates as I build their website!

No more guessing how close the project is to completion. It also helps to keep me and my team accountable.

At the end of the day, my goal is to deliver a killer website, earn a friendship, and grow with the startup community.

Helping founders grow allows me to continuously speak to them and learn how I can provide better startup solutions.

Remember that when you’re thinking about how to make strangers click “buy.”

Remember also the quiet power of posting glowing testimonials on your website.

When collecting reviews, pay attention to the words your customers use to describe your product or service.

Highlight reviews that showcase the impact you’ve created.

Words like “boost,” “solve,” “increase,” and “transform” should be like gold to you.

When newcomers see those testimonials on your website, they’ll think:

💬 “This product isn’t kidding!”

💬 “I want to grow like them too.”

💬 “How have I only seen this solution now?”

Leave them feeling like they’re missing out.

And nothing says “you’re missing out” like proof that everyone else already loves what you do.

Now go get those testimonials, fellow entrepreneur.

p.s.: merry christmas!

I have so many thoughts and ideas, but my friends can only listen to so much lol.

So I journal, and I do it every day.

I love looking back at old entries from specific moments in my life and comparing them to today.

The growth you notice makes you think.

Six months ago, I was in Germany living chaotic, unstructured days that either ended in hangovers or 10-hour train rides.

I was scared but also so, so enlightened. The highlight of my 2024 honestly.

Today, I’m living with a daily routine and letting the work speak for me.

From past journal entries, I rediscovered the art of observing and humbled myself by how massive life is.

(and how small we are in the grand scheme of things)

Imagine the growth you’d notice in yourself if you started writing 6 months ago.

So start writing now. Journaling’s fun for us crazy psychoanalysts……

By now, you should know what it stands for (Search Engine Optimization) and that it can help your business get the attention it needs.

But how do you do SEO correctly for your own startup?

Based on your business model, industry, and other impactful factors, you must consider the angle of which you should implement SEO in your website.

For example, for creative industries, focus on optimising your images and videos to be high quality but fast loading.

For startups in tech, focus on bite-sized content with strategic keyword placement.

Productivity is not hardcore hustle all the time. To me, productivity is time spent with intention.

On Saturdays, I teach kids to play the ukulele, cycle, and spoil myself with a movie or play the guitar.

On Sundays, it’s either a day with the family or an adventurous hike in nature.

I end the evening with a good read or video game.

Been feeling more refreshed on Mondays recently.

Solo founders need to spoil themselves too!

I’ll not be writing about business today.

Today, I want to share a teenage dream of mine.

Since discovering computer science in secondary school, I promised myself that I’d end up in a career in STEM and data.

But that took a negative turn when I failed my math during my O levels.

I was already accepted through EAE but that grade wasn’t enough.

Got so angry that my personality shifted.

Threw myself into hackathons, volunteering, and online courses that are even remotely related to tech.

Yes, I was relentless but there was no direction.

After graduating polytechnic, I realised I needed to slow down, refocus, and actually plan.

This year, I’m restarting my journey into tech with a roadmap that keeps me focused on the ultimate goal: To become a data analyst.

So far, this is what I’ve accomplished this past month:

✅ Completed 2 Kaggle courses, and starting a new one.

✅ Sent out 30+ internship applications, and improving this outreach approach.

✅ Connecting with friends in tech who are ahead of me.

… and there’s still a way to go.

Define your big goal, break it down into milestones, and stick to the plan.

The book “The Winner Effect” by Ian Robertson mentions: Stick to your own word in your commitments.

Do the things you said you would.

I hear this from startup founders all the time, but here’s the truth: it’s really not!

If you want your ideal customers to find you organically, you just need to take the first step.

When I started learning SEO, I made the classic mistake of thinking it was a ""set it and forget it"" task.

But that’s far from the truth!!

SEO is like a plant. You need to nurture it, check in on it, and make adjustments along the way.

Track whether your tweaks are actually making a difference or if you need to shift strategies.

The only investment SEO demands from you is your time.

If you’re a startup founder looking to bring in traffic without blowing your budget, it’s your best friend.

Start small, test often, and watch your website work for you. ;)

Here’s how to reflect your brand’s uniqueness and turn those clicks into conversions:

🔸 Tell your story with a bold headline that stands out.

🔸 Show authentic testimonials to build trust and credibility.

🔸 Write problem-solving copy that grabs attention and drives interest.

When creatives launch a business, they think the magic’s in delivering an amazing service.

Spoiler alert, that’s only one piece of the puzzle ….

Running a business as a creative isn’t just about the fun parts like designing, writing, or creating.

It’s about the not-so-glam stuff too.

Logistics, finances, marketing, branding, partnerships, and keeping cash flow running.

Sure, you’re great at what you do, but who’s making sure the world knows about it?

Who’s landing the clients, managing the contracts, and ensuring you’re not scrambling by next quarter?

Hear me out yea.

The solution to balancing creativity and growth is delegation.

Focus on the tasks that make you feel excited, and let your team handle the rest.

Only do what you’re best at, and do it well.

For me, I balance my inner creative with my executive mindset.

I love forming new relationships with clients a bit more than I enjoy designing banging landing pages.

Understand what you thrive at, and lean into it.

Build your business /your/ way, and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

A thriving creative business isn’t built alone. It’s built smart ;)

As founders, it’s tempting to design websites focusing on what we love about our product or service.

But let’s flip the perspective.

Ask yourself:

👉 What questions will my customers ask when they land on this page?

👉 How can I guide them to the answers seamlessly?

A good user flow hooks visitors, satisfies their curiosity, reassures their doubts, and ends with a no-brainer offer they can’t resist.

Your landing page should not be destroying the reputation of your product.

Instead, it should speak directly to customer needs by building trust and in turn, boosting your conversions.

Your customers should feel like the site was made for them. Empathy is key here.

Leave the ego behind and design for impact.

Your customers will thank you.

Mentoring is when you help someone, and accidentally help yourself.

I started mentoring in secondary school, to guide a junior through her student council presidency run.

These days, I tutor kids in ukulele.

Wish I could find the perfect words to explain how fulfilling it is to see them find confidence in their first chords.

All in all, each experience has taught me this:

Mentoring is a mutual exchange.

The mentee grows, the community gains, and you, as a mentor, find purpose and clarity in your own journey.

Your skills—whether in music, design, coding, or even crocheting—are valuable to someone out there.

So, why not put them to use? Join a volunteer group, post your rates online, or start sharing tips on TikTok.

Mentoring could be the grounding force you’ve been looking for.

Recently, I made a new friend from Melaka, Malaysia.

She’s studying fashion at NAFA and working on a web project about slow living.

We had the best conversation about what slow living means to us and how it looks different for everyone.

To me, slow living is about tuning into your surroundings.

It’s noticing the MRT rumbling beneath your feet, calls of the black-naped oriole (the yellow bird), or how people carry themselves as they walk, stand, or sit.

There’s beauty in slowing down. You start noticing things you’d otherwise miss.

Once, I saw someone sitting on a train platform at 11 PM, working on an assignment.

It must’ve been so important that it couldn’t wait till home!

Besides doing it for the aesthetic, slow living gives you mental and emotional clarity. More control over your life.

Even in a fast-paced country like Singapore, you can find that kind of control.

Instead of taking the bus, cycle.

Instead of doom-scrolling, read a book during commutes.

Instead of rushing out the door, start your day two hours earlier for a calm morning.

How do YOU make time to live slowly?

But what if you used that same storytelling magic on your website?

That’s the potential of story-driven web design*.*

When you turn storytelling into persuasive copy, your audience feels seen and guided.

Got the gift of verbal storytelling down?

Great. Now, let’s bring that magic to your landing page through proven steps:

Awareness → consideration → decision → purchase.

We make hundreds of decisions every day.

What do I eat for lunch? When do I leave the house? Where did I put my glasses? (happens too often)

So like my web designs at The Nadra Agency, I try to keep life simple.

That means saying “no” to anything that doesn’t move me toward my long-term goals.

But before you can say “no” confidently, you need to know what your big goal really is.

That’s where I take a step back and work backwards:

🔸 Define your long-term goal with the eulogy method: think about what you want people to say about you when you’re gone.

🔸 Define your mid-term goals using the wheel of life: identify what you need to improve across key life areas.

🔸 List out your 3 alignment quests: one quest for every life area in work, health, and relationships.

Once you know what to say “yes” to, it becomes easier to create systems that keep you on track every day.

In short—if it’s not a 100% “yes,” it’s a “no.”

CTAs (calls-to-action) can totally make or break your business.

Bland ones like “Learn More,” “Browse,” or “Submit” just don’t cut it anymore.

We’re in 2024.

Customers’ expectations a good user experience has evolved.

They’re looking for writing styles with more personality, more spice …

So clear, human-centered CTAs can be the difference between someone clicking and someone moving on.

You’re gaining an edge over your boring competitors with more effective choice of words.

Try phrases like “Start Your Free Trial,” “Join the Waitlist,” or “Get Your Discount.”

Looking through your landing page and identify all your CTAs.

Are there phrases that are way too unappealing for users to click on?

Being aware of where you lack is the first step to doubling your revenue ;)

For every project, I have had the coolest opportunities to be involved in the lives of other startups.

I get to learn about their journeys, passions, communication styles, and pains.

Recently, I connected with a founder in EduTech who’s revolutionising the education system for primary school kids.

He mentioned his love for his own children and how he wanted the best future for them.

And for that to happen, it starts from creating a nurturing environment for the kids’ self-exploration.

So to learn more about your customers, provide value to them first.

In this context, I advised an EduTech founder about how to get his website up in the most efficient way possible.

In return, he showed me how I can better help tech startups in Singapore make more money.

My heart felt so full after that conversation hehe.

🔸 Direct and actionable CTAs.

🔸 Use visual hierarchy to make the most important info pop out first.

No feedback, no growth.

That’s been my reality while running TNA.

With a UX design diploma under my belt, I’m all about moving based on what users need and prefer.

Give them what they love, and they’ll want more from you.

It makes perfect sense on paper, yea?

But honestly, I didn't take it too seriously—until I saw the real impact testimonials had on my agency.

Now, it’s super satisfying to tweak my processes and watch clients get happier.

It’s a win-win cycle: happier clients, better feedback, more people loving what I do.

So here’s how I keep TNA at the top of its game ;)

1️⃣ I ask for testimonials directly from clients.

2️⃣ I attend conferences focused on the challenges startups face.

3️⃣ I network with other founders at in-person events.

Thousands of conversations later, I've learned how to position myself as a growth partner who understands startup founders.

Turns out, what they care about most is acquiring customers, financial stability, and scaling operations.

If your audience knows the problem you’re solving for them, getting them to buy is way easier.

Happy clients = better business.

The website has not been updated for a long time, nearly 6 months …

In my defense, I get most of my clients through referrals and networking.

But that doesn’t mean I should be ignorant to other acquisition strategies.

Gaining clients via online means, like SEO or social media, is an effective, affordable, and quick way to get your name out there.

Hence, here are some points that helped me optimise TNA’s landing page so far:

✔️ Remove unnecessary micro animations.

✔️ Ensure that site loading speed is no longer than 3 seconds.

✔️ Prioritise sections that users often go to with a bigger font/contrasting colour/an eye-catching image

✔️ Make the website responsive to all screen sizes, including mobile.

Whether your website is used to sell a product or a service, these hacks can be used across all industries.

Not to mention the bland, emotionless copy that’s written on there.

With that kind of website, no visitor would trust you enough to solve their problems!

There are 3 crucial things to implement in your business website, especially if you’re a scaling startup.

1️⃣ Tell your brand story.

Customers love being part of your journey.

Show your team pics, struggles, and successes to build trust. 💡

2️⃣ Add some interactivity to make the web experience fun!

Whether it’s animations or quizzes, keep them engaged with elements that evoke emotion. 🌀

3️⃣ Present an irresistible offer to your target audience.

Make sure your offer stands out and speaks directly to what your customers need. 🎯

Connection, engagement, and delivering value.

With one website, you are speaking to thousands of individuals at a time.

So leverage that as effectively as you can.

But it’s because I’m a bit impatient.

Or efficient. You decide lol.

I spent a lot of time talking with friends about how to make money in the design industry.

We had a lot of different views.

And when it came down to it, I did not meet someone who was aligned with my vision to build a web agency.

So instead of sitting around waiting for the perfect partner to appear I said, “Screw it, I’ll do it myself.”

Almost impulsively, I went ahead and incorporated ""The Nadra Agency"".

Cause another Nadra out there may have the same idea …

9 months later, I’ve worked with numerous founders to multiply their impact in the world, one landing page at a time.

The takeaway (or tapao if u will): Sometimes, waiting for the right person to come along isn’t the move.

You’ve got to take action, even if it means starting on your own.

It’s been a wild ride, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. 👊

All websites contain messaging that is tailored for their intended audiences.

And yours is not so different!

You have a website because you want more people to discover what you do.

You need to craft a personality for your business.

Or a brand, as we call it.

A memorable brand helps you nurture visitors into qualified leads.

How?

When you stand strong and true to your business’ mission, vision, and values, you’ll attract your target clients.

With the right messaging, they’ll feel connected with your purpose and remember you, even after 7 days.

To get the best results, implement SEO on your website as soon as possible.

Decision fatigue is a real thing that solo founders experience.

It’s when you feel burnt out from being the sole decision-maker in your business.

In essence: I’m the CEO, social media manager, project manager, web developer, CRO specialist, and copywriter.

That gives you a general idea of what I do for the web agency.

My worst founder fatigue? It happened recently.

I picked up some side quests to rebuild financial capital for the agency.

Stopped interacting with people on social media for a week to focus on results and wellbeing.

So that pops the question …

How am I responsible for so much while also maintaining quality websites for my clients?

Here is what I do.

1️⃣ I take occasional week-long sprints to spend time nurturing myself and my relationships.

Just ended a sprint last week!

2️⃣ I outsource tasks that don’t mentally uplift me, and focus on those that do.

For example, I don’t have the most fun optimising a site’s SEO.

But I do get the most joy from designing its front-end on Figma and Framer.

Money doesn’t buy happiness, but it does buy you time to work on it.

Do you have any horror stories from running your business solo? 💬

You’re finally releasing your startup’s product to your customers.

One of the channels you MUST leverage is your website.

""How come?""

Because it’s one of the first places customers will go for the latest news about your business.

The advantage of low-code website-building platforms is that they’re easily customizable.

The disadvantage, however, is that startup founders can feel overwhelmed by the millions of design possibilities.

With a huge mental load comes an increased risk of making unwise decisions.

So, here are 5 points you can apply to your website now to prepare for launch day:

1️⃣ Make it easy for users to make their purchase by minimizing the number of steps.

2️⃣ Use clear, actionable language for CTAs to guide users toward taking the next step.

3️⃣ Ensure your website is mobile-friendly to provide a seamless experience for users on phones and tablets.

4️⃣ Keep your navigation menu simple.

5️⃣ Show off testimonials from your trial customers to nudge potential buyers toward trying your product.

Of course, for a product to succeed in making money, you must test it out with target users first.

Fix the kinks.

Then, be super confident about how well it solves your customer’s problems.

This makes promoting your awesome product so much easier for you.

On-page SEO refers to all the optimisations you can make directly on your website.

Using relevant keywords, optimizing title tags, and improving user experience.

Building backlinks, social media marketing, and influencer outreach.

Both are essential for improving your site's visibility and driving organic traffic.

One year ago, I heard the term “productized design” for the first time from @designjoy_co solopreneur, Bret Williams.

It’s basically designing your own website templates and reusing them for all your clients with some personalisation.

At first, I was skeptical about this approach when I resumed freelancing last year,  but I decided to give it a try.

Cause I’m a risk-taker like that :p

However, over time, I didn’t feel fulfilled by the work even though it was fast cash.

I felt like a fraud.

Then, I came across @deanxwhite, founder of @kingcontractoragency.

He leads a design team to make websites that generate revenue for local contractors.

This was my first proper exposure to the concept of CRO.

I became fascinated by the science behind getting people to click “buy” on a website.

So when I started TNA, I became deeply involved with startups, having attempted a few in the past.

Takeaway: With something new and daunting, start small by implementing the core of the idea first.

You have your whole life to scale it.

As an agency owner, constant upskilling is needed.

So I picked up a couple of online courses to remain updated on the latest CRO practices.

It’s very interesting because you get to observe what’s most commonly done by other CRO specialists.

I’m currently trying my hand at applying those new techniques and doing the analysis on TNA’s own website.

This hands on approach helps me to stay ahead of the game and find new ways to boost my clients websites to double their clicks.

… without risking their own conversion rates lol.

I’m also reviewing mine and the agency’s social media channels.

The community is growing but not as much as I expected, because I didn’t hit the goal of 100 followers last quarter.

Upon deeper questioning, I noticed it was due the the quality of the content posted.

Definitely something to work on.

This quarter, I’ll better establish myself as a CRO specialist for startups.

So I’m looking for partnerships to connect with more startup founders so I can help them scale without breaking the bank!

If you know anyone who’s down to do something awesome together, send me a DM.

If your site isn’t optimised for the right audience, it doesn’t matter how many people land there.

Here’s why it’s important for startup founders to focus on quality over quantity:

1️⃣ Your website should speak directly to the pain points of your ideal customer, not just anyone.

2️⃣ A high-converting site guides visitors to sign up, book a spot, or make a purchase.

3️⃣ The more relevant your visitors, the higher your chances of creating a meaningful relationship with them. (and getting them to buy)

More traffic without conversions is just noise fr. 👎
